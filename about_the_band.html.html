Her parents; Bishop Fritz Cobbs and lady Bertha Cobbs raised her in a church called Jesup New Life Ministries.

However, Tasha wasn't just an artist, she was also an influencer with a passion for mentorship. Resulting from this passion came the launch of The iLead Escape Program which is an global ministry mentorship program. This program helps thousands of people with the execution of their talents. In addition to this oprogram she also released her first book titled WORSHIP 101.  </p>
 

<p> In a short amount of time Tasha's career became very successful and she was able to accomplish lots of great things which include: winning a Grammy award, 3 Dove awards, and 3 Steller awards. Church was still something very important to Tasha, there she met her then boyfriend Kenneth Leonard, Back in 2009. Her boyfriend was also in the music industry as a music producer.
